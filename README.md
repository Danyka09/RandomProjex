# 🌌 RandomProjex

Welcome to **RandomProjex** — a collection of my early Python projects as I begin my coding journey.

## 🐍 About Me

Hi! I'm very new to Python (aside from briefly trying it back in 2021). I officially started learning on **August 22, 2025**, and this repository is my sandbox for experimenting and building.

## 📁 What's Inside

This repo includes several small projects I'm working on. I find it easier to keep everything in one place while I learn and iterate.

### 🚀 Current Project: Planet Jumper

**Planet Jumper** is a text-based game where basically colonize different planets and in the end fight against the Emperor of the Galaxy. (more in depth in the word document)

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

I created this repository to:
- Track my progress
- Use as a backup
- Be able to look back to how i started out

- I am very new to python (outside of trying it in 2021) i have started learning on the 22.08.2025 This is a general repository for my first few projects since i find it easier to do it this way. Currently i am working on a text based game called Planet Jumper where you basically colonize different planets and in the end fight against the Emperor of the Galaxy.
