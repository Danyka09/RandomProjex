I am very new to python (outside of trying it in 2021) i have started learning on the 22.08.2025
This is a general repository for my first few projects since i find it easier to do it this way.
Currently i am working on a text based game called Planet Jumper where you basically colonize different planets and in the end fight against the Emperor of the Galaxy. (more in depth in the word document)
